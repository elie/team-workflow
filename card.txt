A playing card is a piece of specially prepared pasteboard, heavy paper, thin cardboard, plastic-coated paper, cotton-paper blend, or thin plastic that is marked with distinguishing motifs. Often the front (face) and back of each card has a finish to make handling easier. They are most commonly used for playing card games, and are also used to perform magic tricks, for cardistry,[1][2] in card throwing,[3] and for building card houses. Some types of cards such as tarot cards are also used for divination. Playing cards are typically palm-sized for convenient handling, and usually are sold together in a set as a deck of cards or pack of cards.

Playing cards are available in a wide variety of styles, as decks may be custom-produced for casinos[4] and magicians[5] (sometimes in the form of trick decks),[6] made as promotional items,[7] or intended as souvenirs,[8][9] artistic works, educational tools,[10][11][12] or branded accessories.[13] Decks of cards or even single cards are also collected as a hobby or for monetary value.[14][15] Different types of card decks can be found in different areas of the worldâ€”while the standard 52-card deck is known and used internationally, other types of cards such as Japanese hanafuda and Italian playing cards are well-known in their locales. Cards may also be produced for trading card sets or collectable card games, which can comprise hundreds if not thousands of unique cards.
